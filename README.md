# Curl-Diaries (curlyhairblog)

Curl-Diaries is a blog built using a Jekyll template, demonstrating my skills in web development, content creation, and providing valuable information for the curly hair community. The purpose of this blog is to review curly hair products based on my personal experience, while also offering curly hair tips to help individuals with their hair care routines.

## About Me

I am a passionate curly hair enthusiast with a TikTok following of 7k followers and 300k likes. Given the demand for product recommendations and information, I decided to create this blog to provide my TikTok audience with an easy-to-access platform for detailed product reviews and helpful tips.

## Features

- **Review Posts**: The blog homepage showcases a collection of review posts, each offering a title and a preview. Clicking on a post's title provides users with an in-depth review.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: The navigation menu consists of three main sections: the blog homepage, an about me page , and a search bar for convenient browsing.
- **Pagination**: With the growing number of review posts, the blog supports multiple pages to ensure a seamless reading experience. Users can navigate through the pages using the "Next" button located above the tags section.
- **Categories Jumbotron**: At the bottom of each page, a Categories Jumbotron offers clickable tags for easy filtering of reviews. Users can explore specific categories such as "Products" to find relevant reviews.
