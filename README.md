# CurlyHairBlog

CurlyHairBlog is a blog built using a Jekyll template that serves as a platform for reviewing curly hair products and providing curly hair tips. The blog aims to help curly-haired individuals make informed decisions about products based on personal experiences and recommendations.

With a growing TikTok following of 7k followers and 300k likes, CurlyHairBlog was created to offer an easy way for your TikTok audience to access product reviews and your thoughts in one place.

## Features

- **Review Posts**: The blog homepage displays a collection of review posts, each featuring a title and a preview. Clicking on a post's title allows users to read the full review.
- **Navigation Menu**: The navigation menu offers three options: the blog homepage, an about me page, and a search bar for convenient browsing.
- **Pagination**: To accommodate a growing number of review posts, the blog supports multiple pages for displaying the reviews. Users can navigate to the next page using the "Next" button located above the tags section.
- **Categories Jumbotron**: At the bottom of every page, a Categories Jumbotron provides clickable tags that filter and display reviews related to specific categories. For example, clicking on the "Products" tag shows reviews specifically focused on different products.
