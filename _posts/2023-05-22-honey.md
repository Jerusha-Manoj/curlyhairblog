The Camille Rose Honey Hydrate Leave-In is my goat hair product. 
One of the standout features of the Camille Rose Honey Hydrate Leave-In is its key ingredient, honey. Honey is a natural humectant that attracts and retains moisture, making it a great choice for dry or dehydrated hair. AKA my hair. This leave-in conditioner effectively moisturizes the hair, leaving it soft, supple, and more manageable.
Many of my Tiktok comments thought I was putting actual honey in my hair. Don’t do that lol. This has more than just honey.
When it comes to performance, the Honey Hydrate Leave-In delivers on its promise of providing intense hydration. The lightweight formula easily absorbs into the hair without weighing it down or leaving any greasy residue. It helps to combat dryness, reduce frizz, and improve overall hair health. 
I noticed, just now, on the bottle that it says “step one”. However, I’ve been using it as my last step. I’ll try it the other way around one day and update this post to see if there is a difference. 


Overall, the Camille Rose Honey Hydrate Leave-In is a highly recommended product for those in need of intense hydration and moisture. Its key ingredient, honey, along with its lightweight formula and versatility, make it a popular choice among individuals looking to nourish and revitalize their hair.
