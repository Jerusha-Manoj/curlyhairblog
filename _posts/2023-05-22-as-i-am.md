The As I Am Classic Leave-In Conditioner is a highly regarded hair product known for its moisturizing and nourishing properties. 
The standout feature of the As I Am Classic Leave-In Conditioner is its ability to provide intense moisture to the hair. It is enriched with a blend of natural ingredients like shea butter, coconut oil, and aloe vera. This leave-in conditioner is particularly beneficial for those with dry or damaged hair, as it helps to restore and maintain moisture balance.
For me, when it comes to performance, it was an okay product. I continue to use it because I don’t want to waste it. I feel like it doesn’t really do anything to my hair. A Lot of the comments I get say that this product is the holy grail, but I don’t see it that way. It is said that some individuals with fine or low-porosity hair may find that using a lighter amount of the product or diluting it with water provides the best results, as the product can be slightly heavy for certain hair types. 
Overall, I still recommend this product. Even though it’s not for me, a good portion of my comments are about this product and how good it is.
