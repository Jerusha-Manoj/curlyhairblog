The Camille Rose Curl Love Moisture Milk Leave-in is a popular hair product that is said to provide moisture, definition, and shine. Here is my review of the product.
Firstly, I like its ingredient list. It is formulated with natural ingredients such as water, rice milk, green tea extract, and aloe vera juice. These ingredients are known for their hydrating and nourishing properties. The absence of sulfates, parabens, and artificial additives is also a plus for those seeking more natural hair care options.
The scent of this leave-in conditioner is amazing. It smells like cupcakes to me. It might be overpowering to those who donâ€™t like the smell of sweets.
When it comes to performance, this leave-in conditioner does deliver on its promise of providing moisture to the hair. However, for those with extremely tight or unruly curls, additional styling products may be needed to achieve the desired level of definition and hold.
Also, I noticed that, for me atleast, the definition of my curls went away over time. I later learned that it has to do with the fact that I have low-porosity hair. Some products do wonders for me but only for a short amount of time. Then my hair goes back to being frizzy. This product fits into that category. If you have low porosity hair you want to make sure to not over moisturize.  It can cause problems like said. It was unfortunate because when this product worked for me, it worked well.
Overall, the Camille Rose Curl Love Moisture Milk Leave-in is a reliable and effective option for those with curly and coily hair. I would suggest this to people who have thicker and normal/high porosity hair.
