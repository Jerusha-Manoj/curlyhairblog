When I first used this product, I thought I would hate it because of the word "strengthen".<br><br>

"Why do you hate that word?" you may ask.<br><br>

It's because I have low-porosity hair. If you don't know, low-porosity hair contains a lot of protein within the hair strand. That is why you want to avoid heavy protein-containing products (or protein overloading can happen). So when I see the word "strengthen," it gives me an indication that the product will have a lot of protein.<br><br>

However...<br><br>

This product was great for my hair. Keep in mind I only used a little bit when I did my hair routine, and I only use it once in a while.<br><br>

Now, would I recommend it? The answer is maybe. First off, I wasn't able to use it alone, and it's a hair butter. I am learning about my hair every day, and I recently found out that hair butters and heavy oils are terrible for low-porosity hair. I have been using that all my life.<br><br>

Maybe it's time for a change.<br><br>

Overall, though, I didn't have a bad experience with this. But I feel like if I used it every time I styled my hair, my hair would be over-moisturized.
