When I first used this product I thought I would hate it because of the word “Strengthen”.<br><br>
Why do I hate that word, you may ask.<br><br>
It’s because I have low porosity hair. If you don’t know, low porosity hair contains a lot of protein within the hair strand. That is why you want to avoid heavy protein containing products (or protein overloading can happen). So when I see the word strengthen it gives me an indication that the product will have a lot of protein. <br><br>
However…<br><br>
This product was great for my hair. Keep in mind I only used a little bit when I did my hair routine and I only use it once in a while.<br><br>
Now would I recommend it… the answer is maybe. First off, I wasn’t able to use it alone, and it's a butter. I am learning about my hair everyday, and I recently found out that butters and heavy oils are terrible for low porosity hair. I have been using that all my life. <br><br>Maybe it’s time for a change.<br><br> Overall though, I didn’t have a bad experience with this. But I feel like If I used it everytime I styled my hair; my hair would be over moisturized.
