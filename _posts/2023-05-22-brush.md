This brush is fantastic for smoothing out your hair. You should definitely get it. It has made my life so much easier.<br><br>

It's particularly great if you ever want to straighten your hair! First, brush your hair with a regular comb to detangle it. Then, when it's time to use heat, use the Conair brush to guide your straightener through your hair. I've noticed that my hair always becomes sleek and smooth with the help of this brush.<br><br>

I highly recommend it!
