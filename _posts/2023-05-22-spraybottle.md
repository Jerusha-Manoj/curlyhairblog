This is a must-have. In order for curly hair products to work at their best, you should soak your hair first. I mean, really soak it.<br><br>

The typical spray bottle just aims a stream of water onto a small portion of your hair, making it take longer to wet your whole head (especially if your hair is thick). However, this is a misting spray bottle that gets water onto large portions of your hair.<br><br>

It's almost like it has a timer on it too. One click, and I swear it mists for 10 seconds. My thumb doesn't have to hurt anymore because I don't have to spray that many times. I highly recommend it.<br><br>
