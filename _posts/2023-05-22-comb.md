The Emoly Detangling Brush stands out with its unique design featuring flexible bristles of varying lengths and widths. I love this brush. It is easy to clean and it can go through my hair. It distributes products into my hair so nicely.
The only downside is the back attachment. Essentially it’s this removable piece attached on the back of the comb to hold apart the bristles. The point of it is to adjust how far apart the bristles are from each other. Hopefully that made sense. It’s a good idea,however,the design was not good. Sometimes it will pop off when I'm detangling my hair, which can be annoying since it takes some time to put back on. But it still works with my hair with or without the back piece.
Overall, the Emoly Detangling Brush is great in detangling with its gentle and effective bristles.
