The Emoly Detangling Brush is, without a doubt, a brush that I absolutely love. This brush is incredibly easy to clean, and it effortlessly glides through my hair like butter (When I use it with product ofc). It also does a fantastic job of evenly distributing products throughout my hair.<br>

The only downside is the back attachment. It's essentially a removable piece attached to the back of the comb, designed to hold the bristles apart and adjust their spacing. I hope that explanation makes sense. Sometimes, though, it can be a bit frustrating as it tends to pop off while I'm detangling my hair. Putting it back on takes some time and can be a little annoying. However, even without the back piece, the brush still works well with my hair. I've developed this strange attachment to this brush, and I don't plan on changing that anytime soon.<br>

Overall, the Emoly Detangling Brush is an excellent tool for detangling. Trust me, you should definitely give it a try!
