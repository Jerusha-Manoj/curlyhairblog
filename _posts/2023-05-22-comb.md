The Emoly Detangling Brush is I love this brush. That's a horrible way to put it but I can't think of anything else. It is easy to clean and it goes through my hair like butter (with product of course). It distributes products into my hair so nicely.<br><br>
The only downside is the back attachment. Essentially it’s this removable piece attached on the back of the comb to hold apart the bristles. The point of it is to adjust how far apart the bristles are from each other.<br><br>Hopefully that made sense.<br><br> It’s a good idea but sometimes it will pop off when I'm detangling my hair, which can be annoying since it takes some time to put back on. But it still works well with my hair with or without the back piece. I have a weird attachment to this brush and I don't plan on changing that anytime soon.<br><br>
Overall, the Emoly Detangling Brush is great in detangling with its gentle and effective bristles. Go get it!
