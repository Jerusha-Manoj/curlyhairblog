I came across innersense when I was researching why my hair products weren’t working the same anymore. My curls always looked dry no matter what I did. For years the products that I used worked for me, until it didn’t.<br>

I saw a video of a girl whose hair looked as dry as mine. By the end of the video her curls were so good and she attributed it all to innersense. The results that people were getting from this brand was insane. I wanted to try it out for myself. So that’s what this post is going to be dedicated to. I will update the post with pictures of my hair to see if this brand works. It’s known to be super clean so much so that people claim they no longer have to use products to see curl definition… <br>

Here is the routine I’m doing with innersense. This brand is a super water based brand. Your hair should be soaking for it to work properly. Like soakkkiiinnng. I started off this journey with their hair detox. I loved it. They said it should cleanse the hair of build up and that it should be used 1-2 times a month. My hair felt super super clean after. I could hear it squeaking. The innersense hairbath has not come into the mail yet, so I kinda skipped that step. Not sure if that was a good idea but my hair needed to be done so I did what I could. Next, I used the hydrating conditioner. Now… Apparently this conditioner is not good for you unless you have damaged or super coarse hair. It can be heavy. I didn’t know this till after I used it :( and these products are very expensive. Lol I’m too broke at the moment to buy the pure harmony conditioner (which is recommended to those with my kind of hair). I guess I will finish this then use save up to buy the one meant for my hair. Finally, I finish with the curl control and gel. I make sure the hair is soaking for this. Overall I will say that my hair does not have that same definition as drugstore products, but I know the definition will come over time (according to people who recommended this product). I am choosing hair health over definition. I will update if I see a difference using the product. I heard the results will happen in a few months. I’m excited.<br>

## Update
I've been using these products for months now. The styling products work so well for me but the shampoo and conditioner was not for me. I noticed that with the shampoo, my hair was falling out, so I stopped using it. It works great for other people, so don't let my experience stop you from getting it. Overall, my hair has never looked healthier! I'm still on the lookout for better shampoo and conditioner. I might have to look at their other lines.
