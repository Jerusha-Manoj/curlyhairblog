I haven't used this shampoo long enough to give it a long-term review. So this will be a short-term review on this shampoo. <br>

The brand, Raw Sugar, aims to deliver effective results while avoiding harsh chemicals and additives. They focus on using natural and plant-derived ingredients, including cold-pressed extracts and organic fruits and vegetables. Which is something I like.<br>
I will say that it made my hair feel clean by touch, but I didn't get that clean feeling. I'm not sure if that made sense. When I use shampoo, I want to feel like my scalp is clean. For some reason I had a feeling of build up. But when I checked, there was none. <br>
I can't hate for no reason like that. So I will give this a "in the mean-time rating" of 4 stars. This might change after long-term use.<br>
