See now personally, I do not like this gel. It works for a few then it’s incredibly drying and makes my hair frizzy.<br><br>
Defeating the purpose of the gel…<br><br>
I had used this product in one of my tiktok videos just for baby hairs to hold down for two seconds. Which is literally how long this gel holds my hair. I hope no one bought this thinking that it would give them the result in my video.<br><br>
It's important to note that people with dry or brittle hair may find this gel to be too drying or potentially damaging over time, as it contains high levels of alcohol and may contribute to further dryness.<br><br>
Because I feel bad wasting it, I use it for my edges. My edges go in all sorts of directions. I will say that even though this gel does not hold the hair down, it allows you to bring your hair in a certain direction. I just want to tame my edges without having the gel look. Ironically this gel does that for me.<br><br>
I do not recommend this product for those who want to use it as a gel. However, your results might be different.
