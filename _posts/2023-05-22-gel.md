See, personally, I don't like this gel. It may work for a short period of time, but then it becomes incredibly drying and makes my hair frizzy. It completely defeats the purpose of using a gel...<br>

I actually used this product in one of my TikTok videos just to hold down my baby hairs for two seconds. That's literally how long this gel holds my hair.<br>

It's important to note that individuals with dry or brittle hair might find this gel too drying or potentially damaging in the long run. It contains high levels of alcohol, which can contribute to further dryness.<br>

Since I feel bad about wasting it, I only use it for my edges. My edges tend to go in all sorts of directions. I must say that even though this gel doesn't hold my hair down, it allows me to guide my hair in a certain direction. I simply want to tame my edges without having that "gel look," and ironically, this gel does that for me.<br>

I personally don't recommend this product for those who intend to use it as a gel. However, your results may vary, so give it a try if you're curious.
