See now personally, I do not like this gel. It’s incredibly drying and makes my hair frizzy.<br><br>
Defeating the purpose of the gel…<br><br>
It's important to note that people with dry or brittle hair may find this gel to be too drying or potentially damaging over time, as it contains high levels of alcohol and may contribute to further dryness.<br><br>
Because I feel bad wasting it, I use it for my baby hairs. My baby-hair goes in all sorts of directions. I will say that even though this gel does not hold the hair down, it allows you to bring your hair in a certain direction. I just want to tame my baby hairs without having the gel look. Ironically this gel does that for me.<br><br>
I do not recommend this product for those who want to use it as a gel.
