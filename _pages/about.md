    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jerusha Manoj but you might know me as @__jerryyy__ on tiktok. Jerry is a nickname that my friends call me. I started my tiktok for fun but I noticed I got a lot of comments about my hair. I started responding to comments with my curly hair routine and hairstyles and people told me I was helping them. So I continued to post about my hair. Throughout the years I had struggled with my hair. I felt like hair products didn't work for me and I spent a lot to find something that could work. I researched my hair and found out about the importance of hair porosity and hair type. Once I found out that I had low porosity hair and, according the online hair quizzes, 3B curls, I started finding products that worked for me. I created this blog because I had a lot of the same tiktok comments. I thought the easiest way to address them was to create/code a website everyone could go to. I'm happy to share what I'm learning about my hair and to review products that worked for me. I want to add a disclaimer that you might have different results or different opinions, and that's okay. Everyone's hair is different :)</p>
