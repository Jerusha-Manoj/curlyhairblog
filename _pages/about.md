    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Jerusha! You probably came from my TikTok @_curl_diaries_. I joined TikTok just for fun, but I quickly noticed that I received a lot of questions about my hair. So, I decided to make a video about my curly hair routine. I didn't expect to have so many people reaching out to me.<br><br>

Over the years, I've struggled with my hair. It felt like hair products just didn't deliver the results I wanted, and I wasted a lot of time and money. Eventually, I started looking into the science of hair care, specifically understanding the importance of hair porosity and hair type.<br><br>

After discovering that I have low porosity hair and, according to online hair quizzes, 3B curls, I went on a journey to find products that could truly help my hair. This has been a game-changer for me, and I'm happy to share my findings with others.<br><br>

That's why I created this blog â€” to write about my ongoing journey of finding products that work for me. The goal of this blog is to provide some convenience to those with curly hair and share my insights and reviews of products that have either worked or not worked for me.<br><br>

However, it's important to note that individual experiences and opinions may vary. Everyone's hair is unique, and what works for me may not necessarily work for everyone.</p>
