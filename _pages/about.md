    <p>Hi everyone, my name is Jerusha Manoj!  You probably came from my Tiktok @__jerryyy__ (Jerry is a nickname that my friends call me). I joined TikTok just for fun, but I quickly noticed that I got a lot of questions about my hair. So, I made a video about my curly hair routine. I didn’t expect to get that many people reaching out to me.<br><br>

The problem was, some of the products in my videos were just used because I didn’t want to waste the product (it’s expensive). My comments were asking where I got those products and I felt bad because I didn’t even like them. I didn’t want to give people the wrong impression so I created this blog to allow people to look at my reviews and then decide for themselves if they wanted it.<br><br>

Over the years, I struggled with my hair. It felt like hair products just didn't deliver the results I wanted and a lot of time and money was wasted. After a while, I began looking at the science of hair care, particularly understanding the significance of hair porosity and hair type.<br><br>

After discovering that I have low porosity hair and, according to online hair quizzes, 3B curls, I went on a journey to find products that could truly help my hair. This was a game-changer for me, and I was happy to share my findings with others.<br><br>

That's why I created this blog — to share my ongoing journey of finding products that work for me. I want to share my tips on a curly hair journey as well. The goal of this blog is to help someone out by creating a little more convenience with their curly hair. I'm happy to share my learnings about my hair and offer reviews of products that have worked/not worked for me.<br><br>

However, it's important to note that individual experiences and opinions may vary. Every person's hair is unique, and what works for me may not necessarily work for everyone.</p>
