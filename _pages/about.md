    <h2>Introduction</h2>

    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Jerusha Manoj, but you may know me as @__jerryyy__ on TikTok. Jerry is a nickname that my friends call me. Initially, I joined TikTok just for fun, but I quickly noticed that my hair became a popular topic among the comments I received. So I made videos on my curly hair routines and hairstyles. People started reaching out, expressing how my videos were helpful to them. Encouraged by their positive feedback, I decided to continue sharing my hair journey on the platform.

Over the years, I personally faced numerous challenges with my hair. It often felt like hair products just didn't deliver the results I desired, leading me to invest significant time and resources in search of a solution. After a while I began looking at the science of hair care, particularly understanding the significance of hair porosity and hair type.

After discovering that I have low porosity hair and, according to online hair quizzes, 3B curls, I went on a journey to find suitable products that could truly help my hair. This was a game-changer for me, and I was happy to share my findings with others.

That's why I created this blog â€” to address the recurring questions and comments I received on TikTok. I wanted to provide a platform where everyone could access this information. Through this blog, I'm happy to share my learnings about my hair and offer reviews of products that have worked/not worked for me.

However, it's important to note that individual experiences and opinions may vary. Every person's hair is unique, and what works for me may not necessarily work for everyone. I hope that this blog is helpful for you and creates a little more convenience in your curly hair journey!</p>
